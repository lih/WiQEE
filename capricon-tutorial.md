This page is intended as a tutorial on the use of a stack-based proof
environment like the one provided on this site. Since we're going to
need to print things out, and we don't yet have the knowledge to write
such features ourselves, let's first import a few useful functions
from a preexisting module.

> 'utils require import

Among other things, this module defines one function that will be of
interest to us : `vis`. When called, this function simply prints out
every hypothesis in context and every value currently on the
stack. It's very useful as the final word in a sentence, to show the
resulting context. It doesn't change anything, so feel free to
sprinkle it at any point of your scripts for debugging purposes.

Now, in order to understand what a stack-based language is, we first
have to understand the basic concept of a *stack*, and the role it
plays during the execution of a script.

Stacks, and The Stack
---------------------

A stack, in general, is a list of values, to which we arbitrarily
assign two extremes, a *top* and a *bottom*. We can operate on either
side, but as a general simplifying convention, all stack operations
will take place at the top unless specified otherwise.

The most fundamental operations that can be carried out on a stack are
*pushing* and *popping* values to and from it (at the top).

<br/>

What does that have to do with CaPriCon ? Well, stack-based languages,
as their name implies, implicitly operate on a stack, that serves as
temporary storage for all the intermediate results of a
computation. When we talk about *the stack*, without any more context,
you can assume we're talking about this one.

In most stack-based languages, including CaPriCon, words designate
*instructions* that modify the stack according to predefined rules,
and complex scripts can be written by stringing words together in the
right order, changing the stack in ever more interesting ways.

Your First Words
----------------

Let's start talking a little. As mentioned above, a sentence (or
program) is comprised of several words separated by whitespace. Words
can fall into one of three categories :

  - *nouns* are constant words, that push a value onto the stack when
     run
  - *verbs* are operational words, that can modify the stack or the
     environment when they are run
  - *quotes* are sequences of *steps*, where a step can be either a
    word step, or a splice step (quotes and steps will de described in
    more detail below).

### Nouns

The simplest kinds of words are *nouns*, more commonly known as atoms
or symbols, and are written as a single quote (`'`), followed by some
non-space characters.

> 'Bender
>? vis
>? 'is 'great vis

As you can see, each noun you write is pushed onto the stack, in the
order in which they appear. Nothing mysterious here.

The CaPriCon interpreter also recognizes numbers[^integer-format], in
the usual decimal format, as another kind of noun, which means they
will mostly behave as expected.

[^integer-format]: For now, 32-bit integers are the default, but if
the need arises, I'll be glad to throw in some BigInt or floating-point
support

> 1 2 100
>? vis

You now know what happens when you write `'vis`, but how does `vis`
alone get interpreted ?

### Verbs and Vocabularies

In parallel to the stack, the interpreter also features its own
*vocabulary*, which provides a correspondance between all the known
nouns and their definitions.

Whenever a verb is run, the interpreter looks into its vocabulary for
the meaning of that verb and executes it, with a different strategy
depending on that meaning :

  - if it is a quote, then the interpreter runs each step in the quote
  - if it is a special builtin operation, then that operation is run
    according to its definition. The initial vocabulary provides a few
    builtins operations of that sort, which are listed
    [here](lexicon.html).
  - otherwise, it is simply pushed onto the stack, as a constant

There are two main verbs to interact with the vocabulary : `def`, for
adding new definitions, and overriding old ones; and `$`, for looking
symbols up. They can be used as follows :

> 'x 3 def 'y 4 def
>? y 'x $ "\"'x $\"=%v; y=%v\n" printf

Of course, the most interesting verbs, and the ones I kept for last,
are the ones referencing quotes, because they allow you to build upon
simpler concepts to yield complex effects.

### Quotes

Many stack-based language have features similar to our quotes. Let's
start there.

The *raison d'Ãªtre* of a quote is, simply put, to be able to write a
program and keep it in stasis, until it can be run from a verb (or
from the stack, using the builtin verb `exec`). In CaPriCon, this
can be achieved by enclosing the sentence you want to "freeze" in
brackets, like so :

> pop pop pop 'is 'great
> { swap 2 shift "%s %s %s !" format }
>? vis
>? exec vis

That's all fairly straightforward, which is nice, but quotes of this
form aren't very dynamic. They will always depend on, and possibly
modify, their surrounding environment during evaluation (a feature
commonly known as "dynamic binding"), which, while very flexible,
doesn't provide a reliable way to write composable programs.

This may not seem like a problem right away, and indeed it isn't for
the kinds of small examples we've been playing with, but for more
reusable scripts, you should always be careful about the environment
you leave behind when you're done with your work. Also, it's kind of a
good feeling when you know your programs won't accidentally rewrite an
index and start an infinite loop.

#### Splices and quotes : a case study

To better illustrate the need for a more powerful construct, let's
imagine we want to be able to execute a quote in a local environment,
so that all nouns defined during that quote's execution don't
accidentally override the outside vocabulary.

The idea is to use the `vocabulary` verb to retrieve the vocabulary
before executing the quote, save that vocabulary somewhere, then run
the quote (which can perform arbitrary modifications to the stack and
the vocabulary), and restore the old vocabulary afterwards using
`set-vocabulary`.

The question is : where do we save the old vocabulary, so that
executing the quote won't accidentally override the place we chose ?
Given what we know about the stack and the environment, nowhere is
safe. A value on the stack can always be `pop`ped or `clear`ed, and a
definition in the vocabulary can always be overridden.

Answer : we save it in a quote. Without further ado, here is the
solution that CaPriCon proposes :

> clear 'local-exec {
>   { exec ,{ vocabulary } set-vocabulary }
>   exec } def
>? { 'x 130 def x 2 * } local-exec x vis

Let's break this down : `local-exec` is defined as the function that,
first, creates a new function by splicing a constant `vocabulary`
between executing the top of the stack (our only argument of
interest), and resetting the vocabulary to whatever the constant was
at the time of creation.

Then, `local-exec` simply executes the newly-created function that
already remembers the `vocabulary` from before. Our argument gets
executed, then the old vocabulary that was captured is pushed on the
stack, only to be restored to its rightful place by `set-vocabulary`.
